# Decorator

This code demonstrates the implementation of the Decorator design pattern in C#. 

The Decorator pattern allows the behavior of an object to be dynamically added at runtime. 

The Component class serves as the base class for objects that can be decorated. 

The ConcreteComponent class is a concrete implementation of the Component class. 

The Decorator abstract class extends the behavior of the Component class, and the ConcreteDecoratorA and ConcreteDecoratorB classes are concrete implementations of the Decorator class. 

The Client code creates a ConcreteComponent object and then decorates it with ConcreteDecoratorA and ConcreteDecoratorB objects in turn. 

The behavior of the decorated object is the result of the combined behavior of all the decorators and the underlying component. 

The Decorator pattern provides a flexible and reusable way to extend the behavior of an object at runtime, without having to modify its underlying implementation.
